## <a id="about"></a>🖳 About

**Minishell** is essentially a mini-recreation of the Unix command-line interpreter (Bash). This project is one of the most complex and rewarding milestones in the 42 curriculum. It requires a deep understanding of `processes`, `file descriptors`, `signals`, and `memory management` in `C`.

Our goal was to create a robust shell that handles:

- `Parsing` and `expanding` inputs.
- Managing `pipes` (`|`) and `redirections` (`<`, `>`, `<<`, `>>`).
- `Executing` `binaries` and `builtins`.
- Handling `signals` behaving exactly like `Bash`.

## <a id="installation"></a>⬇ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

* GCC or Clang
* Make
* Readline library (usually pre-installed on Unix systems)

### Running the Shell

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:larocquel/42_Minishell.git

```

2. **Compile:**

```bash
make

```

3. **Launch:**

```bash
./minishell

```

4. **Clean up:**

```bash
make fclean

```

5. **Extra rules**

```bash
make clean
make re

```

6. **Leak check**

```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --suppressions=readline.supp ./minishell

```

## <a id="fun-facts"></a>✌︎︎ Fun Facts

Did you know?

* **The Name:** "Bash" stands for **"Bourne Again SHell"**. It is a pun on the name of Stephen Bourne, the creator of the original Unix shell (`sh`).
* **The Shebang:** The characters `#!` at the beginning of scripts are called "shebang" (hash-bang). It tells the kernel which interpreter to use.
* **Ken Thompson:** The first Unix shell was written by Ken Thompson (creator of B and co-creator of C) in 1971. It didn't even have pipes back then!
* **Zombie Processes:** In Unix, a child process that has finished execution but hasn't been waited for by its parent becomes a "zombie". Our Minishell makes sure to bury its zombies correctly using `waitpid`.

## <a id="test-matrix"></a>✔ Test Matrix

Below is an overview of suggested test cases.

| Category | Command / Action | Result | Exit Status ($?) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Redirection** | `ls > a > b > c` | Output in `c`. `a` & `b` empty. | 0 |
| **Builtin (cd)** | `unset HOME` then `cd` | Error "HOME not set". | 1 |
| **Builtin (cd)** | `unset OLDPWD` then `cd -` | Error "OLDPWD not set". | 1 |
| **Builtin (export)** | `export 1TEST=val` | Error "not a valid identifier". | 1 |
| **Builtin (export)** | `export =test` | Error "not a valid identifier". | 1 |
| **Execution** | `/bin/ls ../../../bin/ls` | Path resolution works. | 0 |
| **Execution** | `chmod 000 dir; cd dir` | "Permission denied". | 1 |
| **Execution** | `/tmp` | "Is a directory". | 126 |
| **Parsing** | `echo       -n       hi` | Prints `hi` (newline skipped). | 0 |
| **Expansion** | `export A=A; echo $A$A` | Prints `AA`. | 0 |
